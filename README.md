# blender-donut-tutorial

I am following a video guide [Blender Tutorial for Complete Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y) by Blender Guru on youtube.

Looks like the video is broken into multiple parts, so I will track my progress here as I go.

## Episode 1

This video really just goes over the basics of Blender, and how to navigate, we ended up making a monkey with a hat, I forgot to take a screen shot, so let's just move on to episode 2.

## Episode 2
[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBpnKTAc5Eo)

In this video, we start making the basic shape of the donut, and adding some deformity. We learned about things like:

  1. Shade smooth vs Shade flat, and when to use one or the other.
  1. Modifiers, and how to increase the resolution of a mesh with Subdivision modifier.
  1. Edit mode for meshes, as well as proportional editing to speed up the process of sculpting our mesh.


Here is a snapshot of my progress.
